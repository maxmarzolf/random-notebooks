# random-notebooks
A collection of random notebooks!

A repository containing Jupyter notebooks on whatever I felt like doing at the time. 
Some notebooks might not be finished but may contain interesting code I felt like saving at the time.
The data used can generally be found within the same directory the notebook is in.
